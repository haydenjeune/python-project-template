# Python Project Template

Welcome to my python project template.

## Requirements

Ensure `cookiecutter` is installed. A good place to do this at the user level as below.

```
pip install --user cookiecutter
```

To run the generated project, `pyenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` are required. Both can be installed with Homebrew.

## Usage

To create a new project from this template:

```
cookiecutter gh:haydenjeune/python-project-template
```

## Features

Right now this template has the below features, with more to come.

- Dependency management with `virtualenv` and `pip-compile`
- Formatting, type checking, and linting on pre-commit hooks
